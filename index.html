    <ul>
        <li>
            <img src="media/images/Tighnari_Icon.webp" id="Tighnari">Tighnari
            <p>Though originally under investigation by the General Mahamatra for potentially forming academic factions, Tighnari was soon cleared of suspicion as Cyno deemed him to have no ill intentions. Despite Cyno's tendency to remain detached from scholars and scholarship, it was this first impression that caused him to let his guard down and they became close friends. Tighnari now lives in Ghandarva Ville as a forest watcher, but Cyno still makes time to visit when he can, either for dinner or a few rounds of Genius Invokation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="media/images/Collei_Icon.webp" id="Collei">Collei
            <p>On the behalf of Professor Cyrus, Cyno traveled to Mondstadt regarding a letter sent by Lisa about a girl who had been a test subject of the Fatui. After Cyno sealed away the Archon Residue within her body, Collei voiced her desire to learn medicine and explore the world she had spent so long being afraid of. Hearing this, Cyno knew exactly who to go to and brought her to Ghandharva Ville to study under the care of his closest friend Tighnari. He is impressed by the young girl's strength despite having gone through so much.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="media/images/Kaveh_Icon.webp" id="Kaveh">Kaveh
            <p>Though Kaveh and Cyno never really interacted during Kaveh’s time in the Akademiya, they have since become friends as he, Tighnari, Kaveh, and Alhaitham can be seen playing cards at Puspa Café together. Like the others, Cyno considers Kaveh to have good intentions and a well-meaning heart, though sometimes to his detriment as his generosity is what caused him to go into deep debt. Due to the architect’s pride, he won’t admit to needing help so all Cyno and the others can do is look out for their friend and wait for him to come to them on his own terms. The four of them may be friends but he never seems to stop complaining about Alhaitham during dinners with Cyno and Tighnari though…</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="media/images/Alhaitham_Icon.webp" id="Alhaitham">Alhaitham
            <p>Cyno isn’t a fan of people who are too smart for their own good as they tend to think they can control everything and recklessly put themselves into unnecessary danger. Alhaitham, the Akademiya’s Scribe, is one of the ones who he will admit actually is in control of most situations however and has enough common sense to avert potential disasters. They’re coworkers who tolerate each other at best, though Alhaitham isn’t really known to get along with anyone in general, least of all his roommate Kaveh.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="media/images/Lisa_Icon.webp" id="Lisa">Lisa
            <p>A fellow Spantamad student from Cyno's time in the Akademiya, as well as his adoptive sister, Lisa and Cyno both studied under Professor Cyrus. Though they don't get many chances to talk to each other since Lisa moved to Mondstadt after completing her studies at the Akademiya, the two of them still hear from each other from time to time. Since graduating, Lisa hasn't been very ambitious with further research, having seen just what the pursuit of knowledge can do to a person, and seeing as Cyno himself has seen his fair share of tragedy befalling scholars who become too ambitious, he understands her decision. Lisa fondly likes to call him her baby brother, much to his embarrassment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="media/images/Cyrus_Icon.png">Cyrus
            <p>While originally from the desert, Cyno was taken to the Akademiya as a child after becoming the vessel for a powerful divine spirit named Hermanubis. It had been the hopes of the higher ups to turn Cyno into a test subject, but Professor Cyrus instead adopted Cyno and raised him as his son, helping him through the suffering he endured from the divine spirit’s powers. One of the most important things Cyrus taught Cyno was that without the Akademiya’s laws, wisdom would shortly turn into calamity as some scholars might try to tamper with the very essence of life and death itself, completely detached from the recognition of human life in the pursuit of knowledge, and Cyno keeps those words with him to this day as he carries out his duties as the head of the Matra. The other significant thing Cyno learned from him was his sense of humor.</p>
